**OVERVIEW**

Write a simple, responsive, web app in angular/react that shows a public calendar, editable by anyone on the web.
We expect to see 2 pages in this app. (calendar page and add/change event page).
We recommend you to use a 3rd party UI library (material, prime, bootstrap, etc)

**API**

You will use 4 endpoints: fetch events, add event, change event, delete event

**GOALS**

1. Show us your coding skills - We want to see your strengths, donâ€™t be afraid to go wild, add
features and customize the design.
2. Readability - Your code should be readable and self-explanatory with minimum
comments. Remove any unused code, console logs, and files. Use logical project
structure and code separation.

**SPECS**

3. Display today by default.
4. State management is a must!
5. Responsive design is a must! (flexbox/grid will give you extra points ðŸ˜‰).
6. Error handling is a must! (can be done with toast, modal).

**BONUSES**
7. Add search for event by name.
8. Add dark/light theme support (add toggle button in the header).
9. Add animations (with good taste).
